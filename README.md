# prework-study-guide

## Description
The purpose of this project was to create a study guide using HTML, CSS, Github, and JavaScript. This helped build a foundation for what we are going to be learning in the bootcamp by introducing the different aspects that make up a webpage and how they interact with eachother. 


## Installation

## Usage
This Prework-Study-Guide is useful because it is a good example of what working code looks like. Not only are the notes on HTML, CSS, Github, and JavaScript valuable, but the code itself is a great reference as well. It could be used to help troubleshoot issues with code or even serve as a means to test out new ideas.
